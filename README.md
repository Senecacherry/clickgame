This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a memory game using React. The application's UI is split into four components.

## Instructions

1. Create a new React application using Create React App.

2. The app will render 9 images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image will listen for click events.

3. The app will keep track of the user's score. The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

4. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

5. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.
